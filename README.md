## JavaScript Validation

The form validation is implemented using JavaScript in the `<script>` tag at the bottom of the HTML file. Here are the key components:

- Form field references: JavaScript variables are used to reference various form fields.
- Event listeners: Event listeners are attached to the form fields to validate user input.
- Validation functions: Functions are defined to validate specific form fields.
- Error handling: Error messages are displayed for invalid form fields.
- Submit handling: The form is submitted only if all fields are valid.

## Additional Notes

- The example demonstrates various types of form field validations such as required fields, email format validation, checkbox validation, and credit card number validation.
- The example does not implement any server-side validation. It is purely for demonstration purposes.
- The JavaScript code is included directly in the HTML file for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, it is recommended to separate the code into separate files for better maintainability.
